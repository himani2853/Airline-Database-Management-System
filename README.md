# Airline-Database-Management-System

The project focused on developing a centralized database for airline companies, aiming to consolidate all relevant data into a single, cohesive system. Instead of maintaining separate databases for meals, employees, flights, and other aspects, the database serves as a unified repository.

Airline companies can leverage this database to store and manage details about scheduled flights, company employees, airports, and various services offered. Additionally, the database provides valuable insights, enabling companies to identify popular travel destinations, the most preferred in-flight meals, and their most loyal passengersâ€”allowing them to offer targeted rewards. This centralized data also aids in making informed decisions regarding flight fares, scheduling, and crew assignments.

The key learning outcomes from this project included database design, entity-relationship diagrams, integrity constraints, normalization, and the development of a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the system.
